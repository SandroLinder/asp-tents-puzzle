## Puzzle
Tents (sometimes known as "Tents and Trees") is a popular logic puzzle. According to https://wpcunofficial.miraheze.org/wiki/Tents it was first published by LÃ©on Balmaekers with the Dutch name "Alle Ballen Verzamelen" in 1989.

Rules:

* Place tents on the grid, so that each tree has a unique horizontally or vertically adjacent tent. This also means that no tent can "serve" more than one tree.
* Tents should not be adjacent to each other (neither horizontally, nor vertically, and also not diagonally).
* The given numbers for rows and columns have be equal to the number of placed tents in the respective row or column.

## Solver
Requirements:
* python3
* clingo CLI tool

The solver can be run by using the command:
```
clingo asp_tents_solution.lp <input>.lp
```
